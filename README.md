## Execution Instructions:

`1.  Tomita`
- Keep the datasets in the same directory as the code tomita.cpp, and change the path of the infile in the main function (line 84) to this .txt file.
- Also change the path to the outfile to any .txt file in line 10 of the tomita.cpp file.

`2. ELS`
- Keep the datasets in the repository, in the same directory as the code, with the same names. 
- Compile the file els.cpp using "g++ els.cpp" and run it using "./a.out".
- When asked for testcase number, enter 1 for Enron, 2 for WikiVote and 3 for Skitter.
- Output will be printed in a new .txt file.

`3. Chiba`
- Keep the datasets in the same directory as the code chiba.cpp, and change the path of the infile in the main function (line 167) to this .txt file.
- Also change the path to the outfile to any .txt file in line 168 of the tomita.cpp file.

## Dataset Preparation

- The datasets were preprocessed by firstly making the vertices zero-indexed.
- Then we converted directed graphs to undirected by eliminating edges that were repeated i.e. if edge A had from node X and to node Y, and edge B had from node Y and to node X, either A or B was removed. This was done by a simple C++ code.
